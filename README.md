# Hoagie Template

Hoagie Club's app template repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed. You can install Bun via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
brew install bun
```

### Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
bun install
```

### Running the App

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

```bash
bun run dev
```

The app will now be running locally, and you can view it in your browser at localhost:3000.

### Backend

The backend setup depends on the specific Hoagie Club app you're working on. Refer to the app-specific [documentation](https://docs.hoagie.io/) for backend details.
