/**
 * @overview Auth0 client configuration for HoagieTemplate.
 *
 * By default, the following properties claims from the ID token are added to
 * the user object in the session automatically:
 * - sub
 * - name
 * - nickname
 * - given_name
 * - family_name
 * - picture
 * - email
 * - email_verified
 * - org_id
 *
 * If you'd like to customize the user object to include additional custom
 * claims from the ID token, you can use the beforeSessionSaved hook.
 *
 * It's best practice to limit what claims are stored on the user object
 * in the session to avoid bloating the session cookie size and
 * going over browser limits.
